A modern React app prototype for AI-powered Digital Tourist ID generation, safety monitoring and incident response.

## Features
- Multi-step registration to generate a Digital Tourist ID
- Police dashboard (mocked) with heatmap/clusters and zone risk assessment
- Analytics pages and sample UI for AI detection and mobile app
- Mobile-responsive, modern UI using React functional components

## Setup
1. Copy the files into a folder named `smart-india-tourism-safety-system`.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the dev server (http://localhost:3000).
4. Run `npm run build` to build for production.

## Notes
